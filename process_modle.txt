Waterfall model

Planning 
We want a main window with login with admin mode, login with view mode and sign up button. 
User can create event and see other user's event and decide if they are going to attend or not
Header class function - 5 days (2 people)
Main program design and test - 1 week(5 people)
Ui design - 2 weeks (6 people)

Design
User will need to sign up to access admin mode and view mode, 
 --admin mode
	user can create event within legal time(ex. Dec.25 won't be a available), the event will be added to view mode
 --view mode
	user can see all the event created by other users and can select event they want to attend
Code
Use python/Pyqt5 for coding and QT designer for UI 

	Main window -- admin mode, view mode, and signup, and two input box for account number and password
	View window -- events window(selectable), selected window
	admin Widow -- a calendar, time selector and input box for event name information box for event that user created


Compile
Use PyCharm to compile

Test
Create user, add a event in admin mode and we will be able to see this event in view mode, there will be error message if the user trying to attend a conflict event, wrong password or do not have a account
